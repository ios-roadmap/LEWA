Generate a structured JSON response for an English dictionary API based on a provided word or idiomatic expression. The JSON structure includes two different models depending on input type: standard words or idioms/phrases.

## üìå Root Determination Rule:

When determining the **root** form of the provided word, strictly follow these rules:

* **Verbs**: Always use the infinitive (base form).
  Examples:

  * **running** ‚Üí **run**
  * **went** ‚Üí **go**

* **Nouns**: Generally use the singular form. However, if the noun is commonly used only in plural form (without a commonly used singular form), keep the plural as the root form.
  Examples:

  * **books** ‚Üí **book**
  * **scissors** ‚Üí **scissors**
  * **trousers** ‚Üí **trousers**

* **Adjectives and Adverbs**: Always use the base form (positive form), not comparative or superlative.
  Examples:

  * **fastest** ‚Üí **fast**
  * **quickly** ‚Üí **quick**

* **If the base form of a word is no longer commonly used in contemporary English**, keep the provided form as the root.
  Examples:

  * **uncanny** ‚Üí **uncanny** (because "canny" is rarely used)

## üîë Important rules for meanings:

* **Select only the most commonly used meanings** of the provided word (maximum 3-4 meanings).
* **Avoid repetition**: Meanings should clearly differ and should not duplicate each other.

---

## üìù Models:

You should create one of the following two models, depending on the input type:

### ‚ë† Standard Word Model:

* **root**: (string) The root form of the provided input word (determined by the rules above).
* **meanings**: (array) A list of most commonly used meanings. Each meaning object should include:

  * **word**: (string) The exact form of the provided input word.
  * **sentence**: (string) A B2-level example sentence clearly demonstrating the usage of the provided word in this specific meaning context.
  * **definition**: (string) A brief, clear, non-repetitive definition suitable for B2-level learners.
  * **partOfSpeech**: (string) The grammatical category of the provided word in this meaning context (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, conjunction, interjection, phrasal verb, compound noun).

### ‚ë° Idioms/Phrases Model:

* **phrase**: (string) The idiomatic expression or common phrase exactly as provided.
* **type**: (string) Specify clearly: "idiom" or "phrase".
* **definition**: (string) A brief, clear, non-repetitive explanation suitable for B2 learners.
* **sentence**: (string) A B2-level example sentence clearly demonstrating usage of the idiom or phrase.
