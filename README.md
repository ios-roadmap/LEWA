### Output schema

```json
{
  "root": "",               // base (lemma) of {word}
  "meanings": [               // every distinct sense of {word}
    {
      "sentence": "",       // original B2-level English sentence (10–20 words)
      "trSentence": "",    // accurate Turkish translation
      "definition": "",    // clear English meaning (≤ 20 words)
      "partOfSpeech": ""   // noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc. as used in the sentence
    }
  ],
  "wordFamilies": [           // ALL valid affix forms + common derived forms, excluding the root
    {
      "word": "",           // family member built with allowed affixes or other derivations
      "partOfSpeech": "",  // noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.
      "sentence": "",       // original B2-level English sentence (10–20 words)
      "trSentence": "",     // Turkish translation
      "definition": ""      // concise English meaning (≤ 20 words)
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rules

1. **root** – give the lemma only (e.g., *run* for *running*).
2. **wordFamilies** – include:

   * Every existing word formed from the root using these affixes:
     *Suffixes*: -s, -es, -ed, -ing, -en, -er, -est, -ly, -ness, -ment, -tion, -ation, -ity, -ship, -hood, -ous, -ful, -less, -y, -ish, -al, -ive, -ist, -ism, -dom
     *Prefixes*: un-, in-, im-, il-, ir-, dis-, non-, re-, pre-, sub-, over-, under-, en-, de-
   * Additional frequent derived forms (e.g., compound or irregular derivatives) useful for IELTS.
   * Apply irregular spellings where necessary; output everything in lowercase.
   * Exclude the root itself.
3. **meanings** – provide one object per distinct sense; each must include:

   * A 10–20-word original English sentence at B2 level.
   * Its precise Turkish translation.
   * A clear definition (≤ 20 words).
   * The relevant part of speech.
4. **No English Equivalent** – If the supplied word has no established English counterpart, identify the closest English word by meaning or morphology and apply all rules using that word instead.
5. No duplicate sentences. Keep all JSON valid: double quotes, commas, no comments.
6. Output **only** the JSON object—no headings, explanations, or extra text.
