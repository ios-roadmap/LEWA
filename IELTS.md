# 📌 Metin (Eksiksiz)

**Dear parent volunteers,**

I am writing **in regards** to the city’s plans to make big cuts to the education budget. **One can understand** that this might be necessary to save money. However, the city also plans to increase its budget for turning the abandoned space on Madison Street into a park. The space has been empty for over twenty years! Only now is the city deciding to change it, because some major businesses just opened up in the area.

**It seems clear** that the mayor and our officials do not value the importance of education. **Furthermore**, they have been quoted as saying that making cuts to the education budget is the last option for the city. Clearly, the opposite is true. I am **highly** disappointed with the city’s decision to focus on an abandoned space instead of investing in our children’s education. For **those who** are concerned about the city’s plans, please join me on May 21 at the Williams Center downtown.

**Sincerely,**
Laura Jones

# 📌 Metin (IELTS Writing Task 2 Essay Versiyonu)

**Introduction**
The issue of government spending priorities has always been a controversial topic. Recently, the city has decided to cut the education budget while simultaneously investing in transforming an abandoned space into a park. While **one can understand** that financial constraints may require certain adjustments, this decision raises serious concerns about the city’s commitment to education.

**Body Paragraph 1**
On the one hand, it is true that public parks provide recreational spaces and can improve the quality of life in urban areas. From this perspective, **one can understand** why the city might allocate funds to such projects. Additionally, the abandoned space on Madison Street has been unused for more than two decades, and businesses in the area may welcome its transformation.

**Body Paragraph 2**
However, **it seems clear** that prioritizing a park over children’s education is a misguided choice. Education is the foundation of future development, and cutting its budget could harm students, teachers, and the community as a whole. **Furthermore**, officials have been quoted as saying that education cuts would be a “last option,” yet the opposite has occurred. This contradiction undermines trust in local leadership.

**Body Paragraph 3**
As a result, many residents are **highly** disappointed with the city’s current decision. Education should always be treated as a long-term investment, far more valuable than short-term infrastructure improvements. For **those who** believe in the importance of children’s future, protesting this decision or attending community meetings can be effective ways to demand change.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, although some may justify the creation of a public park, reducing the education budget is not a sustainable or responsible policy. Governments must prioritize education if they aim to ensure long-term social and economic growth. Only through consistent investment in schools can a city truly prosper.
