## Generate a concise Englishâ€‘dictionary entry for **one or more** inputs

*(word, multiâ€‘word unit, proverb, or idiom) suitable for IELTS Academic Bandâ€¯7 / CEFRâ€‘B2.*

---

### 0â€¯â€¯Parenthetical information

The input may include text in parentheses immediately after the headword, e.g.
â€¯â€¯`proportional (directly & inversely)`â€ƒorâ€ƒ`run (verb)`â€ƒorâ€ƒ`bank (TR: banka)`

* Treat everything inside the **final** pair of parentheses as **metadata only**.

  * It may signal sense, part of speech, translation, or other context.
  * **Never copy the parentheses or their contents into the output.**
* **Multiple items:** If the metadata lists several alternativesâ€”joined by **&**, **/**, or commasâ€”treat *each* item as a separate input:

  * Generate a separate entry for every listed item (e.g. *directly proportional* and *inversely proportional*).
  * Format the multiple entries exactly as in Â§â€¯4 and separate them with `-----`.
* **Single item:** If the metadata contains only one item, use it simply to select the most relevant sense.

### 1â€¯â€¯Spelling

* Silently correct misspellings; do **not** mention the correction.

### 2â€¯â€¯Root extractionÂ â€” **absolutely no inflection in the output**

> **ðŸ”´â€¯Mandatory rule:** If the input differs from its dictionary lemma **only by an inflectional ending**
> â€‘â€¯verbsâ€¯(â€‘s,â€¯â€‘ed,â€¯â€‘en,â€¯â€‘ing)â€ƒâ€‘â€¯nounsâ€¯(pluralâ€¯â€‘s/â€‘es)â€ƒâ€‘â€¯adjectivesâ€¯(comparativeâ€¯â€‘er, superlativeâ€¯â€‘est)
> **then:**
>
> * set **`rootâ€¯=â€¯wordâ€¯=â€¯the lemma`**;
> * **never show** the original inflected form anywhere;
> * write theâ€¯`definition`â€¯andâ€¯`sentence`â€¯with that lemma.

Headwords must always be dictionary lemmas. Never output an inflected form as the `word` field.

1. **Inflection** â€“ lemmatise all inflected forms. If lemmatisation is the only change, stop here (rule above).
2. **Candidate lemma check** â€“ if the lemma is valid and has **no derivational suffix**, set `rootâ€¯=â€¯wordâ€¯=â€¯lemma`.
3. **Prefix stripping** â€“ remove one recognised derivational prefix (unâ€‘,â€¯reâ€‘,â€¯misâ€‘,â€¯disâ€‘,â€¯overâ€‘, etc.) until a valid word appears; the first valid word becomes **root**.
4. **Suffix stripping** â€“ after prefix stripping, remove one recognised derivational suffix (â€‘al,â€¯â€‘ity,â€¯â€‘ous,â€¯â€‘ly,â€¯â€‘ment,â€¯â€‘ance,â€¯â€‘ence,â€¯â€‘ant,â€¯â€‘ent, etc.) until a valid word appears.
   *If removing a suffix changes the core meaning, keep the longer form as **word** and the shorter valid form as **root**.*
5. **Multiâ€‘word heads** â€“ for noun compounds, isolate the head noun first, then apply stepsâ€¯1â€‘4. For phrasal verbs, treat the verb only (*look after*â€¯â†’â€¯*look*).
6. **Orthography** â€“ make minor fixes if needed (â€‘i â†’ â€‘y, double consonants).
7. **Fallback** â€“ if no valid word emerges, use the original input as the **root**.

### 3â€¯â€¯Meaning selection

Provide **one** common, everyday sense of the inputâ€™s part of speech, guided (if present) by the parenthetical metadata.

* **Definition** â€“ â‰¤â€¯15 words, B2 vocabulary, start with a lowercase letter, use the lemma only.
* **Example sentence (16â€‘20 words):**

  * Include the **word** (identical toâ€¯`root`) **exactly once**.
  * Must contain **exactly one** Academic Word List (AWL) word or collocation.
  * Must contain **exactly one** lessâ€‘frequent B2 word (e.g. *restrict, container, overflow*).
  * Use formal register; avoid contractions.
  * Include **exactly one** of the grammar devices listed below (cycle them across calls):
    â€¢ concessive clause (*although, even though, though*)
    â€¢ conditional clause (TypeÂ 0â€‘3 or mixed)
    â€¢ reason clause (*because, since, as*)
    â€¢ purpose clause (*so that, in order that, so as to*)
    â€¢ result clause (*soâ€¯â€¦â€¯that, suchâ€¯â€¦â€¯that*)
    â€¢ contrast clause (*while, whereas*)
    â€¢ relative clause (defining / nonâ€‘defining)
    â€¢ participle clause (present / past / perfect)
    â€¢ linking adverb (*however, therefore, nevertheless, moreover, consequently*)
    â€¢ inversion (condition / concession)
    â€¢ cleft sentence for emphasis

### 4â€¯â€¯Output format

**Standard lexical unit**

```
root: <root>
word: <headword>            # always identical to root for purely inflected inputs
definition: <concise definition>
sentence: <example sentence>
```

**Proverb / idiom**

```
expression: <exact phrase>
definition: <concise explanation>
sentence: <example sentence>
```

When processing multiple inputs, format each entry separately and separate them with `-----`.
